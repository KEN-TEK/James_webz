            <h3>A Nearby Planet with Abundant Life-Supporting Molecules</h3>
            <img src="images/exoplanet.jpg" alt="An artist's depiction of the exoplanet K2-18b">
            <p>In September, the JWST discovered methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a nearby exoplanet named K2-18b, which is larger than Earth. This could be a habitable planet given its proximity to its star.</p>
